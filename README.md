# CoulombPlay

CoulombPlay is an interactive 2D simulation of charged particles and their electric field, built with the Python Arcade library. It visualizes both field vectors and field lines for a small system of moving point charges.

## Features

- Dynamic motion of electrons, protons, and alpha particles under Coulomb forces.
- Two visualizations:
  - Vector field (arrows on a grid).
  - Field lines starting from positive charges.
- Simple keyboard controls for toggling view and randomizing the configuration.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+ (recommended)
- `arcade` library

Install dependencies with:

```bash
